<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The commands in this guide will help you explore and create the world of Adventure.TXT.</p>
<p>Many of the commands allow you to create features in the world. As other players interact with the features you create, your score increases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 id="areas">Areas</h3>
<p>The main screen displays information about an area. Areas can be physical locations (e.g., Sicilia's Pizzeria), or they can be a more abstract state of being (e.g., Engulfed in Flames). Areas have a <strong>title</strong> and a <strong>description</strong>.</p>
<p>To edit the title or description of an area, type "edit area" at the prompt.</p>
<p>Areas also display information about other players who area present, as well as messages that have been left by players passing through.</p>
<p>New areas can be created by typing their name in the Lobby, or when creating a new connection.</p>
<p>Areas created from the Lobby are automatically <strong>published</strong> to the Lobby's area listing. Other areas can be published to this list by entering "publish" at the prompt while in that area. Simliarly, areas can be removed from the list using the "unpublish" command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 id="connections">Connections</h3>
<p>It is possible to move between areas using <strong>connections</strong>. If any area has any connections, they are listed below the description. Connections can be physical directions or any other kind of action (e.g., "north" or "jump into the fire"). Each connection leads to a specific area. When you enter the name of that connection at the prompt, the area display will update to show a new area.</p>
<p>Connections can be added by entering "create connection [title]" at the prompt, where [title] is the title of the connection. Connections can also be deleted by entering "delete connection [title]".</p> 
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 id="players">Players</h3>
<p>When you enter an area, any other players also in that area will be listed under the area's description.</p>
<p>Players can also leave messages for each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 id="messages">Messages</h3>
<p>Anything entered at the prompt that is not recognized as a command is left in the current area as a message. The message remains even after you leave the area. You can delete a message by clicking the [x] symbol next to it.</p>
